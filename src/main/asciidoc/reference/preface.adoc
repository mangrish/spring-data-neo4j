= About the Spring Data Project

http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/[Spring Data] is a SpringSource project that aims to provide Spring's convenient
programming model and well known conventions for NOSQL databases.
Currently there is support for graph (Neo4j), key-value (Redis), document (MongoDB) and relational (JPA) databases.

The Spring Data Neo4j project, as part of the Spring Data initiative, aims to simplify development with the Neo4j graph
database.
Like JPA, it uses annotations on simple POJO domain objects.
Together with metadata, the annotations drive mapping the POJO entities and their fields to nodes, relationships, and properties in the graph database.

== About Spring Data Neo4j 4
For version 4.0, Spring Data Neo4j was rewritten from scratch to natively support Neo4j deployments in standalone server mode.
It uses Cypher, the Neo4j query language, and the HTTP protocol to communicate with the database.
It's therefore worth noting that there *will be backward compatibility issues* when migrating to version 4.x, so be sure to check the <<migration,Migration Guide>> to avoid any unwanted surprises.

Version 4.1 introduces support for connecting to an embedded instance of Neo4j.

For integration of Neo4j and other languages, please see http://neo4j.com/developer/language-guides/[Language Guides].

= Overview

The explanation of Spring Data Neo4j's programming model starts with some underlying details.
The basic concepts of the http://neo4j.com/docs/ogm/java/stable/[Object-Graph Mapping (OGM) library] used by Spring Data Neo4j internally, is explained in the initial chapter.

== Getting Started
To get started with a simple application, you need only your domain model and (optionally) the annotations (see <<reference_programming-model_annotations>>) provided by the library.
You use annotations to mark domain objects to be reflected by nodes and relationships of the graph database.
For individual fields the annotations allow you to declare how they should be processed and mapped to the graph.
For property fields and references to other entities this is straightforward.

== Adding Neo4j Graph Queries
To use advanced functionality like Cypher queries, a basic understanding of the graph data model is required.
The graph data model is explained in the chapter about Neo4j, see <<neo4j>>.

== Managing Relationships
Relationships between entities are first class citizens in a graph database and therefore worth a separate chapter
(<<reference_programming-model_relationships>>) describing their usage in Spring Data Neo4j.

== Repositories
Spring Data Commons provides a very powerful repository infrastructure that is also leveraged in Spring Data Neo4j.
Those repositories consist of a composition of interfaces that declare the available functionality in each repository.
The implementation details of commonly-used persistence methods are handled by the library, which makes them very convenient for typical CRUD and query operations.
The repositories are extensible by annotated, named or derived finder methods (like in (G)Rails).
For custom implementations of repository methods you are free to add your own code. (<<reference_programming-model_repositories,CRUD with repositories>>).

== Neo4jTemplate
Being a Spring Data library, Spring Data Neo4j offers a <<reference_programming_model_template,Neo4jTemplate>> for interacting with the mapped entities and the Neo4j graph database if you don't want to use repositories.
As of version 4, `Neo4jTemplate` is based on the `org.neo4j.ogm.sessionFactory.Session` object and adds mostly exception translation around the functionality.
Support for Spring Data Neo4j Repositories is also based on `Neo4jTemplate`, so the underlying functionality is identical.

In keeping with the Spring Data ethos, an operations interface is used to define the API exposed by the `Neo4jTemplate`.  This interface is called `Neo4jOperations`, the default implementation of which is `Neo4jTemplate`.  Users of the framework from version 4 are encouraged to code against `Neo4jOperations` instead of the `Neo4jTemplate` directly.


== Mapping Strategies
Because Neo4j is a schema-free database, Spring Data Neo4j uses a simple mechanism to map Java types to Neo4j nodes using labels.
How that works is explained here: <<reference_programming-model_simple-mapping,Simplified Object Graph Mapping>>.

== Transactional Support
Neo4j uses transactions to guarantee the integrity of your data and Spring Data Neo4j supports this fully.
The implications of this are described in the chapter around <<reference_programming-model_transactions>>.

== Configuration
Currently, only Java bean-based configuration is supported. See <<reference_setup>> for more details.

== Examples
The provided samples, which are also publicly hosted on http://github.com/neo4j-examples[Github], are explained in <<reference_samples>>.

== Performance
Spring Data Neo4j 4 has been rebuilt from the ground up with performance in mind.
More information can be found in <<reference_performance,Performance Considerations>>.
//This chapter also discusses which use cases should not be handled with Spring Data Neo4j.
